3. Planned changes for v 1.0:
    - replace awful word "element" with a "item"; I don't know why I use "element" :);
    - finishing Readme ;) - write about _customizer, write description of features;
    - other issues, that will turn out necessary during using;
    - maybe reorganize code - it can always be better and simpler :)
